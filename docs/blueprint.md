- AI Image Generation: Generates a creative image based on hypothetical questions or scenarios.
- Interactive Chat Display: Presents the AI's responses and generated images in a visually appealing chat bubble format, as if coming from the magic lamp.
- AI Image Gallery: Features a gallery to display the recent AI-generated images, along with the question that prompted the image.
- Informational 'About Us' Section: Includes an 'About Us' section to describe the website's purpose and functionality.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a vibrant fantasy color palette, including amethyst purple (#9966CC), sky blue (#87CEEB), mystic gold (#D4AF37), rose pink (#FF69B4), and emerald green (#50C878), to create a magical and whimsical atmosphere.
- Accent color: Electric Lime (#7CFC00) for highlights, interactive elements, and the 'Imagine It' button.
- Employ a clean, readable font with slight magical embellishments, such as a stylized serif or handwritten-style font, for textual content.
- Utilize playful and expressive icons to represent various interactive features, such as share buttons, history logs, and settings.
- Ensure a responsive and intuitive design, with the magic lamp and input box prominently displayed across all devices.
- Incorporate detailed animations for the magic lamp character: ears sprout when listening, eyes widen when typing, and the lamp brings a hand to its chin when thinking. When revealing an image, the lamp presents both hands forward as if saying, 'Take it.'
- Incorporate subtle yet engaging animations, such as sparkles, glows, and fluid transitions, to enhance the magical feel of the site.
